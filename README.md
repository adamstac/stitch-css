# Foundation

## To Do

* All the CSS3 helpers should include the official syntax version too
* Pattern files that import all sub-patterns to make it easier to import everything
* A main file that will import all patterns, helpers and functions (but not the reset)
* Develop the grid.scss helper file more
* Fill out the font-stacks helper
* Fill out the forms helper
