		<h1>Overview</h1>
		<p>Stitch is an extension for Compass that gives you quick access to CSS design patterns you use every day.</p>
		<p>These patterns generally perform a particular function. We rewrite these styles on every project and the function of these particular blocks of styles is obscure in our code. We need a way to abstract these common patterns.</p>
		<p>Stitch is more than a framework. It's pattern ideology extends further than just chunks of code. <strong>It aims to create patterns in your workflow and the structure of your CSS to change the way you write CSS.</strong></p>

		<section id="what">
		<h1>What Stitch Does</h1>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Make our stylesheets free from clutter</li>
			<li>Give our styles more meaning</li>
			<li>Reduce the size of our working stylesheet</li>
			<li>Patterns are written once</li>
			<li>Patterns are updatable when newer methods are discovered</li>
			<li>Creates a set of conventions to follow</li>
			<li>Stop worrying about where to put styles</li>
		</ul>
		</section>
		
		<section id="how">
		<h1 id="how-stitch-works">How Stitch Works</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Common CSS patterns in the form of mixins and classes</li>
			<li>Desktop browser reset that follows the conventions of the framework</li>
			<li>Install patterns into your directory using commands so you don't have to think about common tasks, like adding a font or adding a new layout.</li>
		</ul>
		</section>
		
		<section id="examples">
		<h1>Example</h1>
		<p>Standard CSS code might look like this:</p>
		<pre><code>#id {
	
}
</code></pre>
		<p>Let's break that down into something more manageable;</p>
		<pre><code>#id {
	@include clear-floats;
}
</code></pre>
		</section>
		
		<section id="rules">
			<h1>Rules &amp; Conventions</h1>
			<p>Stitch is built with conventions in mind. While these aren't ever forced upon you, if you follow these conventions, you'll be a happier person. I'll list out the conventions of the framework and then explain them.</p>
			
			<h2>Avoid Global Styles</h2>
			<p>We've come to believe that complete inheritance is a good thing in CSS. While it has it's benefits, it needs to be controlled if we plan to make our CSS modular. </p>
			
			<p>The most common example of this (as seen in every static CSS framework) is <strong>styling of text nodes globally</strong>. Most people style the <code>h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6</code> tags at the root assuming it is correct to inherit these styles all the way down, but this causes a lot of issues down the track:</p>
