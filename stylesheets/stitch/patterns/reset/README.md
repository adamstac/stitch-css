# Reset

The reset include with this framework is a little bit different from normal reset files. 

* It doesn't include obscure elements that people don't often use
* It resets all form styles
* It resets all text to be the same as the body, including links
* Lists, code and links (in fact, all text) are reset to look the same
* Fixes the box-sizing inconsistencies between browsers. This is the cause of most cross-browser issues with form styles
