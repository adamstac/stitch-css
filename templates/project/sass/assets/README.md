# Assets Folder

This folder is where the majority of your assets, such as fonts and images, will live. Keeping them in this single spot makes them easy to access from any layout.

Assets can include a stylesheet that allows layouts to easily use them. In the case of fonts, a stylesheet should be included with the @font-face method so that layouts only need to import the stylesheet to use the assets. The same method could be used for backgrounds, icons etc.
